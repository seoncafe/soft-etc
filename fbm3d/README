Purpose:
   Generate a Fractal Medium according to the algorithm described in
          Seon (2012, ApJL, 761, L17) and Seon & Draine (2016, ApJ, 833, 201)
   Please cite the above, two papers if you use this software.

Version: 1.1, (2017-11-18) slightly updated, and comment added.

Prerequisite:
      0. You need to download and compile the following libraries.
      1. CFITSIO library (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/)
      2. FFTW library    (http://www.fftw.org/)

Howto run:
   1. Copy the sample input file and edit the input file.

      iseed = 0    : Initial Seed (default 0 is always ok.)
      bvale = 0.4  : b-value to define the dispersion of density. (default 0.4 is good in most cases.)
      mach         : Mach number
      nx           : number of cells in x-dimension, (the same numbers will be assumed for y, z-dimensions)
      out_file     : fits file name for the output image
      out_mode = 1 : 1 gives you the density distribution as an output (default)
                     2 gives you the amplitude cube in Fourier space which was used to produce the density.
